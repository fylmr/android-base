# android-base

Collection of useful Android code to reduce reinventing the wheel and speed up development.

No project imports are used as Android Studio will suggest you the best available import options for your project. 
Most of the classes are redundant or, on the contrary, contain only a few lines of code because copying and making changes according to the project needs takes equal time as writing it from scratch.
